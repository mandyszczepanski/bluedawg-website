# BlueDawg Landing Page - Hormozi Framework Audit

**Date:** February 22, 2026  
**Reviewer:** Jordan (Ghost) - Board of Directors Review  
**Framework:** Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers + Value Equation  
**Page Reviewed:** https://bluedawg.app (live) + app/page.tsx source

---

## Overall Grade: B+

**Strong foundation. Missing the kill shots that turn a good page into an irresistible offer.**

The copy is well-written, the positioning is sharp, and the pain amplification is above average. But Hormozi would look at this page and say: "You're selling the plane ride, not the vacation." There are specific, fixable gaps that are costing conversions right now.

---

## Value Equation Breakdown

### Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)

| Driver | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Dream Outcome** | B | "Business that runs itself" is good but abstract. No specific numbers tied to THEIR outcome. What does "runs itself" mean in dollars? |
| **Perceived Likelihood** | C+ | Weakest area. No case studies, no testimonials, no specific results. "20+ AI Systems Deployed" is vague. Who? What happened? |
| **Time Delay** | B+ | "First workflows in 2 weeks, ROI in 60-90 days" is solid. Could be stronger with a "Day 1" win. |
| **Effort & Sacrifice** | A- | "No prompts. No babysitting." is excellent. The DFY positioning is strong. This is the page's best quality. |

---

## What We Nailed

### 1. Pain Amplification (A)
The problem section is Hormozi-grade. "You're Paying 47 People to Do What 3 AI Agents Handle Before Breakfast" is a headline that makes people feel the pain in their wallet. The five pain points are specific, relatable, and hit where it hurts. The "cost of doing nothing" urgency box is textbook.

### 2. Effort & Sacrifice Reduction (A-)
"No prompts. No babysitting. No AI tools you have to learn." This is exactly what Hormozi preaches - make the bottom of the Value Equation as close to zero as possible. The entire positioning as "workforce, not tool" is the right move. DFY beats DIY every time.

### 3. Epiphany Bridge (A-)
The "This Isn't Another AI Tool" section is a strong origin story. "We spent 4 years... we kept seeing the same thing... tools don't do work, people do work." This builds credibility and differentiates. The "power drill vs. construction crew" analogy in the FAQ is chef's kiss.

### 4. Feature-to-Benefit Translation (B+)
The "What agents do / What you stop doing" table format is excellent. Every feature is framed as a pain you eliminate. Hormozi would approve of this structure.

### 5. Competitive Positioning (A)
Positioning against ChatGPT, Zapier, and chatbots is smart. You're not competing with other AI workforce companies - you're competing with the inferior solutions they're already using. Category of one.

---

## What We Missed

### 1. ZERO Social Proof (F)
This is the biggest hole on the page. Hormozi's #1 driver of "Perceived Likelihood of Achievement" is social proof. There are:
- No testimonials
- No case studies
- No specific client results
- No logos
- No "before and after" transformations
- The comment `{/* Social proof section - testimonials coming soon */}` is literally in the code

**The stats bar (20+, 100+) is weak sauce.** "100+ Businesses Running" running WHAT? What HAPPENED to those businesses? Did revenue go up? Did costs go down? By how much?

### 2. No Specific Dream Outcome Numbers (C)
Hormozi would say: "You're selling the concept, not the result." The page never says:
- "Save $X per month"
- "Reduce team by X people"  
- "Respond to leads X% faster"
- "Generate X more content pieces per week"
- "Close X% more deals"

Everything is qualitative ("runs itself," "never sleeps," "24/7"). Prospects need NUMBERS to anchor the value against the price.

### 3. Guarantee Is Buried and Weak (C+)
The guarantee - "No measurable ROI in 6 months? We optimize free for another 6" - is actually decent. But:
- It's a tiny pill badge at the bottom of pricing, easy to miss
- It should be its own section with a bold headline
- It needs a sexy name (not "the BlueDawg promise")
- "Measurable ROI" is vague. What counts as measurable? Define it.
- Hormozi would make this LOUDER and MORE SPECIFIC

### 4. Value Stack Is Weak (C)
The pricing cards list features but don't STACK value with dollar amounts. Hormozi's playbook says to assign dollar values to each component:
- "Custom AI workforce audit & blueprint" - what's that worth standalone? ($5,000? $10,000?)
- "Purpose-built agent team" - what would it cost to hire humans for this? ($150K/year?)
- No total value stack number that makes the price feel like stealing

The "$36,000+ total value" and "$128K+ value" are there but buried in tiny gray text. These should be SCREAMING.

### 5. No Scarcity or Urgency (D)
Zero scarcity mechanics on the page:
- No client cap ("We only onboard X clients per month")
- No cohort deadline
- No price increase warning
- No waitlist language
- Nothing that creates "I need to act NOW"

### 6. CTA Links to Generic Calendly / Mailto (C)
The "Book a Demo" button goes to `https://calendly.com` (not even a custom link). "Start Your Audit" and "Talk to Our Team" both go to `mailto:hello@bluedawg.app`. This is amateur hour for a company selling $30-50K engagements. Needs a proper intake form or at minimum a branded Calendly.

---

## Top 3 Changes That Would Increase Conversion

### 1. ADD REAL SOCIAL PROOF (Estimated Impact: +30-50% conversion)
This is the single biggest lever. Even 2-3 specific results would transform this page.

### 2. ADD SPECIFIC DOLLAR OUTCOMES TO THE VALUE STACK (Estimated Impact: +15-25% conversion)
Assign real dollar values to every line item. Show the "you're paying $2K/mo for $36K+ in value" math prominently, not in 11px gray text.

### 3. MAKE THE GUARANTEE ITS OWN SECTION AND NAME IT (Estimated Impact: +10-20% conversion)
Pull it out of the pricing footer. Give it a full section. Make it impossible to miss.

## Rewritten Sections (Weak → Hormozi-Grade)

### Rewrite #1: Hero Subhead (Add Specific Outcome)

**Current:**
> BlueDawg deploys an autonomous AI workforce that works like a dawg so you don't have to - handling customers, creating content, managing operations, and closing deals 24/7 while you focus on what actually matters.

**Hormozi Rewrite:**
> BlueDawg deploys an autonomous AI workforce that handles your customers, creates your content, manages your operations, and closes your deals 24/7. Our clients cut operational costs by 40-60% and reclaim 80+ hours per week of human talent for high-value work. All without learning a single prompt.

### Rewrite #2: Guarantee Section (New Standalone Section)

**Current:** Small badge under pricing.

**Hormozi Rewrite - Full New Section:**

```
## The "Work Like a Dawg" Guarantee

We don't hide behind vague promises. Here's exactly what we guarantee:

Deploy BlueDawg. Use it for 6 full months. If you can't point to measurable ROI - 
reduced costs, increased revenue, time saved, leads converted - we will optimize 
your entire AI workforce for free for another 6 months until you do.

No fine print. No weasel clauses. We win when you win.

Why can we guarantee this? Because we've done it 100+ times. We know what works. 
And we don't take clients we can't help.

🛡️ 6-Month ROI Guarantee - or 6 more months on us.
```

### Rewrite #3: Pricing Value Stack (Show the Math)

**Current:**
> $2K-$3K/mo  
> $5,000 setup · $36,000+ total value

**Hormozi Rewrite:**

```
Here's what you're actually getting:

✓ Custom AI workforce audit & blueprint ............... $10,000 value
✓ Purpose-built agent team (replaces 2-3 FTEs) ........ $150,000/yr value  
✓ Persistent memory & learning system .................. $5,000 value
✓ Full tool integration (CRM, social, email, calendar).. $8,000 value
✓ Parent AI monitoring & continuous optimization ........ $24,000/yr value
✓ Dedicated onboarding & configuration ................. $5,000 value
✓ Monthly performance reviews & agent updates ........... $12,000/yr value

Total Annual Value: $214,000+

Your Investment: $5K setup + $2-3K/mo ($29-41K/year)

You're paying ~15 cents on the dollar. And that's before counting 
the revenue your AI workforce generates.
```

### Rewrite #4: Add Social Proof Section (New)

Even placeholder-structured for when real data comes in:

```
## The Numbers Don't Lie.

[Case Study Card 1]
"BlueDawg cut our support response time from 4 hours to 47 seconds. 
Customer satisfaction went from 72% to 94%. We reassigned 3 support 
reps to sales - they generated $340K in new revenue last quarter."
- [Name], [Title], [Company]

[Case Study Card 2]  
"We were spending $8K/month on a content agency and getting 12 posts. 
BlueDawg produces 60+ pieces per week in our voice. Engagement is up 
3x. We canceled the agency."
- [Name], [Title], [Company]

[Case Study Card 3]
"Our lead response time went from 'whenever someone remembers' to 
under 60 seconds. Close rate increased 28% in the first 90 days."
- [Name], [Title], [Company]
```

### Rewrite #5: Add Scarcity (Under Pricing)

**Current:** Nothing.

**Hormozi Rewrite:**
```
⚡ We onboard a maximum of 5 new clients per month. 
Each deployment requires hands-on configuration by our senior team. 
We'd rather do fewer deployments exceptionally than many deployments poorly.

February: 2 spots remaining.
```

## Section-by-Section Grades

| Section | Grade | Hormozi Verdict |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Hero | B+ | Strong hook, needs specific outcome numbers |
| Stats Bar | C | Vanity metrics without context. "100+ businesses" doing WHAT? |
| Problem | A | Best section on the page. Real pain, real specificity. |
| Epiphany Bridge | A- | Great origin story and differentiation |
| How It Works | B+ | Clear, simple. Could add "by Day X you'll see Y" |
| Features Table | B+ | Great format, good benefit framing |
| Architecture | B | Technical credibility, but prospects don't buy architecture |
| Use Cases | B | Good segmentation, but quotes aren't real testimonials |
| Pricing | C+ | Needs value stacking, dollar amounts, and comparison anchoring |
| Guarantee | C+ | Decent guarantee, terribly presented |
| FAQ | B+ | Smart objection handling, especially the ChatGPT answer |
| Final CTA | B | Urgency language good, but CTA links are broken/generic |
| Social Proof | F | Nonexistent. Page-killing omission. |

---

## Final Verdict

**This page is 70% of the way to being a conversion machine.** The copy is sharp, the positioning is differentiated, and the pain amplification would make Hormozi nod. But you're leaving serious money on the table by:

1. Having ZERO social proof on a page selling $5K-$50K+ engagements
2. Not showing specific dollar outcomes anywhere
3. Burying the guarantee
4. Not stacking value with real numbers
5. Having no scarcity or urgency mechanics
6. Linking CTAs to generic Calendly/mailto

**Hormozi's one-line review:** "Great copy, no proof. You're asking people to spend $30K based on promises. Show me the receipts."

**Priority order for fixes:**
1. Get 3 real case studies/testimonials on this page (even if they're from LeadCatcher clients using the same tech)
2. Add specific dollar outcomes to hero + features
3. Build out the guarantee as its own section
4. Add value stacking with dollar amounts to pricing
5. Add scarcity (client cap per month)
6. Fix CTAs (branded Calendly, proper intake form)

Do these 6 things and this page goes from B+ to A+.
